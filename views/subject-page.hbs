            Islam, and its teachings are pivotal in understanding Islam. Based
            on the essay, it can be concluded that the major themes of the Holy
            Quran are God, prophets, man, divine scriptures, and sin. God is
            merciful, forgiving and is above all what is on earth and in heaven.</p>

            The second part delves into social and cultural realities of the

          <h5 class="card-title">Arabic calligraphy</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Arabic Calligraphy has reached its perfect form
            after evolving and being refined over centuries by the greatest
            masters of their times. There is an advanced and precise geometry in
            every letter and shape, reflecting the fact that Muslim artists were
            heavily focused on geometry and patterns as forms of art. Islamic
            Calligraphy is written using a traditional pen made of reed. The
            earliest style is known as the Kufic style which has sharper edges
            and corners compared to many of the other later developed styles
            such as Thuluth, Diwani, Riqâ€™ah and others. These styles can be
            thought of as different font types, and the tip of the reed pen is
            cut differently for each of the writing styles.</p>
